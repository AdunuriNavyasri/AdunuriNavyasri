            </p>mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space 
            </p>programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the 'Missile Man of India' for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
            </p> launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since 
            </p>the original nuclear test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party 
            </p>and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and 
            </p>public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

            </p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.
            </p> Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
